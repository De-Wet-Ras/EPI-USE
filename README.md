# Employee Sorter Project

## Overview
The Employee Sorter Project is a Java application designed to process employee and relationship data, construct a hierarchy, and submit the processed data to a server. This README explains how to set up, run, and use the application, as well as its file structure for users accessing it from GitHub.

## Instructions to Run the Project

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-sorter.git
   ```
3. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd employee-sorter
   ```

### 2. **Open the Project in NetBeans**
1. Launch NetBeans IDE.
2. Go to `File -> Open Project`.
3. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository.
4. Select the project folder and click `Open`.

### 3. **Configure the Application**
The project requires a `config.properties` file to be properly configured with API endpoints and a candidate token. Verify the following fields in the file:
```properties
employee_url=<API URL for employee data>
relationship_url=<API URL for relationship data>
submit_url=<API URL for submitting data>
candidate_token=<Your Candidate Token>
batch_size=100
```

### 4. **Run the Main Class**
1. In NetBeans, locate the `EmployeeSorterDeWetRasFinal` class.
2. Right-click on the file and select `Run File` to start the application.

The program will process employee and relationship data and submit it to the specified server. Console logs will display the progress and outcomes of each step.
